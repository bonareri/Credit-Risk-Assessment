# Credit Risk Assessment: Predicting Loan Defaults

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to build a Credit Risk Assessment system to help financial institutions evaluate the risk of loan applicants. Effective credit risk assessment is crucial in minimizing loan defaults, improving lending decisions, and ensuring financial stability.

## 2. Problem Statement

Financial institutions face challenges in accurately assessing borrowers' creditworthiness. Poor risk evaluation can lead to high default rates, financial losses, and an unstable credit market. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict credit risk, enhance decision-making, and minimize potential losses.

## 3. Objectives

This project aims to achieve the following goals:

- **Analyzing Historical Loan and Credit Data** – Identify patterns and trends in borrower behavior.
- **Implementing Machine Learning Models for Risk Prediction** – Develop and train models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to classify loan applicants as low-risk or high-risk.
- **Evaluating Model Accuracy and Optimizing Performance** – Assess model performance using key metrics and fine-tune hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.

## 4. Data Collection

### Data Source

The dataset used for this project can be sourced from:

- **Public Credit Risk Datasets:**
  - Kaggle Credit Risk datasets
  - Lending Club loan data
  - UCI Machine Learning Repository

### Features in the Dataset

The dataset includes the following key features:

- **Demographic Information:**
  - Age
  - Employment status
  - Income level
- **Credit History:**
  - Credit score
  - Number of past loan defaults
  - Number of credit inquiries
- **Loan Details:**
  - Loan amount
  - Interest rate

- **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Measures the borrower's debt obligations relative to income.
- **Delinquency History:** Previous instances of late or missed payments.
- **Loan Purpose:** The intended use of the loan (e.g., home, education, business).

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Understanding Data Distribution:**
  - Visualizing key statistics and distributions of numerical and categorical features.
- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Identifying relationships between different variables.
- **Class Imbalance Handling:**
  - Addressing imbalanced datasets using techniques like SMOTE or weighted classification.
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Creating new features and transforming existing ones for better model performance.

## 6. Model Development

- **Baseline Models:**
